    <h1>The <span class="BigText">Raven</span></h1>
    <h2>By Edgar Allen Poe</h2>
    
    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
    <p>Only this and nothing more.”</p>

    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
    <p>Nameless here for evermore.</p>


    And the <span class="BigText">Raven</span>, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting<br>
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>
    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
    <p id="FinalLine">Shall be lifted—nevermore!</p>
