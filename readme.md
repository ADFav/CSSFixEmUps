#CSSFixEmUps

It's the night before your English assignment is due, and your poem just doesn't have the flair it needs to stand out. Following the cues in the comments in the CSS code, write property-value pairs to style the poem. The selectors have already been written for you, but you will need to research some of the property names you'll need on your own. When you have finished the lab, study the HTML and CSS code to see if you can learn about classes and IDs.

Remember, all CSS staements look like the following

```CSS
selector{
  property : value;
}
